# Paper, Scissors & Strategy

Welcome to the adaptive Rock‚ÄìPaper‚ÄìScissors arena!  
This project powers a web-based experience where you can battle a shape-shifting AI opponent that learns from your moves in real time. The focus of this public release is pure gameplay: pick a difficulty, choose a strategy flavour, add a personality twist, and try to outsmart the robot.

## Play The Game

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **UI** | Single-page web app (Flask backend + rich frontend dashboard) |
| **Modes** | Human vs AI (single-player) |
| **Rounds** | 25 by default (configurable) |
| **Controls** | Click the buttons or press `P` (paper), `R` (rock), `S` (scissors) once the match starts |
| **Status Board** | Live win/tie counts, confidence gauges, personality banter, streak alerts |

### Opponent Settings

1. **Difficulty**  
   - *Rookie* ‚Äì forgiving, plenty of randomness.  
   - *Challenger* ‚Äì balanced learner with mid-tier pattern tracking.  
   - *Master* ‚Äì reacts fast to streaks and short patterns.  
   - *Grandmaster* ‚Äì uses a blended ML ensemble, punishes repetition, far less exploration.

2. **Strategy**  
   - *To Win* ‚Äì picks the counter to the most likely human move and takes risks for victory.  
   - *Not To Lose* ‚Äì prioritises avoiding losses, aiming for safe wins or ties.

3. **Personality**  
   Each personality re-shapes confidence and move choices. For example:  
   - *Aggressive* (Berserker) sharpens counterattacks after your streaks.  
   - *Defensive* (Guardian) prefers ties when you‚Äôre on a roll.  
   - *Unpredictable* (Wildcard) injects volatility to keep you guessing.  
   - *Cautious* (Professor) hunts deeper patterns methodically.  
   - *Confident* (Mirror) mirrors your playstyle to beat you at your own game.  
   - *Chameleon* adapts dynamically whenever performance dips.

Start a new match any time with the **Reset** button. The AI retains no memory between games unless you opt into developer features (disabled in this public release).

   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate       # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Launch the web app**
   ```bash
   cd webapp
   flask --app app run
   ```
   Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.

3. **Play**

## What Makes The AI Tick?

- **Adaptive human model** ‚Äì Tracks your move frequencies, multi-order patterns, and how recently you‚Äôve switched tactics. Grandmaster blends in an ML ensemble for extra bite.
- **Strategy layer** ‚Äì Converts predictions into move scores. *To Win* goes for the jugular; *Not To Lose* hunts for safe results.  
- **Personality layer** ‚Äì Adds character. Aggression, risk tolerance, and confidence sensitivity all alter the final move and the tone of the banter.
- **Anti-repeat guard** ‚Äì Higher difficulties get stricter when you spam the same move.
- **Developer-friendly instrumentation** ‚Äì Simulations, analytics, and deeper docs live in the developer readme (see below).

## Tips & Tricks

- Try mixing your moves early. Grandmaster penalises streaks quickly once it spots them.  
- Personalities can work for or against you. Playing against *Wildcard*? Expect chaos. Facing *Guardian*? Exploit its desire to tie.  
- The dashboard‚Äôs ‚ÄúRecent Momentum‚Äù card highlights your 10-round bias. If you see ‚ÄúPaper 70‚ÄØ%‚Äù, so does the AI.  
- Want a chill match? Stick with Rookie/Neutral/Not-To-Lose. Looking for pain? Grandmaster/To Win/Aggressive.

## Advanced & Developer Resources

- **Developer documentation** lives in `DEVELOPER_README.md` (ignored by default, intended for contributors).  
- **Simulation output** from the in-house test suite is stored under `simulation_results/`.  
- **Tests** ‚Äì Run `python - <<'PY'\nimport pytest\npytest.main(['tests/test_adaptive_ai.py','-q'])\nPY` to validate AI behaviour.
